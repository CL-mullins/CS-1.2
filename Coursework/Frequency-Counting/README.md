Creating a Frequency Counting assignment for Joi's Class!

In this assignment, I create functions that create a Hash Table array, inserts functions into a hash table, turn keys into index values, prints key value pairs from the table!

TODO: Create a YouTube video for the assignment rather than uploading to GradeScope!
